Short Project Overview:
  The hexapod is a low-cost, six legged, 3 joints, hexapod that is to be designed for STEM education and potential early field prototyping. Build using off the shelf components form amazon, it provides hands-on learning in robotics whild being 
affordable and upgreadeable. 


 Key Features:

  -6-dof hexapod design with 18 servos
  -25 kg*cm high-torque servos
  -modular 3D printeable frame
  -Sensor expanison (LiDAR, camera, touch and environmental sensors)
  -open-source and repairable hardware
